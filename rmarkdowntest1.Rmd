## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. You can pretty much do whatever you like. You can also track your changes using Git (such as on a Github account).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Shiny Applications
You can now also embed what are known as "Shiny" applications into an R Markdown file. This lets users interact with plots and tables (or TLFs).
Below, we are using a WorldPhones dataset, that presents the number of telephones by region over the years. The user can select the region from a drop-down menu, which generates a new plot containing the requested information.
Shiny applications are just bits of R code that can be tailored to all kinds of data and analysis requests.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# shinyApp(
#   
#   ui = fluidPage(
#     selectInput("region", "Region:", 
#                 choices = colnames(WorldPhones)),
#     plotOutput("phonePlot")
#   ),
#   
#   server = function(input, output) {
#     output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
#       barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, 
#               ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
#     })
#   },
#   
#   options = list(height = 500)
# )
```


Here is what the R code for the shiny application above looks like. I have added "eval=False" so that the code is not run again:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
shinyApp(
  
  ui = fluidPage(
    selectInput("region", "Region:", 
                choices = colnames(WorldPhones)),
    plotOutput("phonePlot")
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
      barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, 
              ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
    })
  },
  
  options = list(height = 500)
)
```
