## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. You can pretty much do whatever you like. You can also track your changes using Git (such as on a Github account).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(rsconnect)
shinyApp(
  
  ui = fluidPage(
    selectInput("region", "Region:", 
                choices = colnames(WorldPhones)),
    plotOutput("phonePlot")
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
      barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, 
              ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
    })
  },
  
  options = list(height = 500)
)
```
